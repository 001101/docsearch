title: What is DocSearch?
---

DocSearch is born out of the need to scratch our own itch. As developers, we
spent a lot of time reading documentation, and we often found it hard to find
relevant information we need quickly. We're not blaming anyone here; building
a good search is a challenge.

It just happens that we are a search company and we actually have a lot of
experience building search interfaces. We wanted to use those skills to help
others. That's why we created a way to automatically extract content from tech
documentation and make it available to everyone with only a few keystrokes.

DocSearch itself is made of a crawler and a frontend library. We run the
crawler on our end every 24h to extract content from your website and push it to
an Algolia index. You'll then have to add the frontend library to your website
to redirect all the search requests to this index.

DocSearch is entirely free and mostly automated. The only thing we'll need from
you is to read [our checklist][2] and apply! After that, we'll share with you
the JavaScript snippet needed to add DocSearch to your website. We just ask that
you keep the "powered by Algolia" link displayed.

DocSearch is [one of our ways][1] to give back
to the open source community for everything it did for us already.
