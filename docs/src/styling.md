DocSearch default colorscheme comes in a grey theme with blue highlight. 

![Default colorscheme](./assets/default-colorscheme.png)

This theme works well with most websites, but we encourage you to style it to
your own theme. This can be achieved by overriding the CSS classes used by the
default theme. 

The following annotated example will help you style each part:

```css
/* Match title (eg. Bootstrap CDN) */
.algolia-docsearch-suggestion--title {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: black;
}

/* Match description (eg. Bootstrap currently works...) */
.algolia-docsearch-suggestion--text {
  font-size: .8rem;
  color: gray;
}

/* Match category (eg. Downloads) */
.algolia-docsearch-suggestion--subcategory-column {
  color: gray;
}

/* Match main category (eg. Getting Started) */
.algolia-docsearch-suggestion--category-header {
  color: darkgray;
  border: 1px solid gray;
}

/* Highlighted text */
.algolia-docsearch-suggestion--highlight {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Debugging

If you want to inspect the dropdown markup with your browser tools, you should
add `debug: true` to your `docsearch` call to prevent it from closing on
inspection.

```javascript
docsearch({ 
  [â€¦],
  debug: true
});
```

## Other considerations

Selected suggestion are wrapped in a `.ds-cursor` class. This means
that you can use `.ds-cursor .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--content` to style
the selected suggestion for example.

On small screens, DocSearch reverts to a single column layout, while the
two-column layout shown in the screenshot is used on larger screens. You can
media queries (for example `@media (min-width: 768px) {}`) to target one or the
other display.

**We ask you not to try to hide the _search by Algolia_ logo through CSS, as its
display is mandatory if you're using the free hosted version of DocSearch.**


## Advanced styling

If you want to more heavily style the results, feel free to have a look at the
[SCSS source code](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/tree/master/src/styles).
`_variables.scss` contains all the default theming, sizing and breakpoints.

You can generate your own CSS file by cloning the repo and running `yarn run
build:css`. The resulting file will be generated in `./dist/cdn`, and should be
used instead of the default one.
