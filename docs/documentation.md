## Introduction

We're scratching our own itch here. As developers, we spend a lot of time reading documentation, and it isnâ€™t always easy to find the information we need.

Not blaming anyone here. Building a good search for a documentation is a complex challenge. We happen to have a lot of experience doing that, and we want to share it with the world. For free.

Just submit the form on the [community.algolia.com/docsearch/](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) website and we'll get back to you with what you need to integrate your new search into your website.

 1. We'll crawl your documentation pages,
 2. We'll configure your search experience,
 3. and you'll need to add the a small JS/CSS code snippet to your website.

## Setup

Once we've crawled your documentation website we'll send you the credentials you need to add the following code snippet to your website:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/docsearch.js/0/docsearch.min.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/docsearch.js/0/docsearch.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
docSearch({
  apiKey: '<API_KEY>',
  indexName: '<INDEX_NAME>',
  inputSelector: '<YOUR_INPUT_DOM_SELECTOR>'
});
</script>
```

## Customization

To customize the look & feel of the dropdown menu, you can either:

 * edit the color [variables](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/master/src/styles/_variables.scss) and rebuild this project CSS,
 * or override the colors like we did in [dev/docsearch-styling.css](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/master/dev/docsearch-styling.css).
